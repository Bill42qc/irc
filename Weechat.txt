Join a Channel:
Once connected to a server, you can join a channel using the /join command. For example:

/join #example_channel



WeeChat, like other IRC clients, expects various numeric responses from the IRC server after sending the authentication credentials. The specific numeric codes can vary depending on the server and the authentication process.

Common numeric responses related to authentication include:

001 - RPL_WELCOME: Indicates a successful connection and authentication. The server sends a welcome message.
433 - ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE: Indicates that the chosen nickname is already in use. You may need to choose a different nickname.
464 - ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH: Indicates a password mismatch or incorrect password.
465 - ERR_YOUREBANNEDCREEP: Indicates that you are banned from the server.



Switch between Buffers:
WeeChat uses the concept of "buffers" to manage different chat sessions and information. You can switch between buffers using the /buffer command or by pressing Alt+Left/Right Arrow keys.


Send Messages:
To send messages in a channel or private message, simply start typing your message and press Enter. WeeChat uses the input bar at the bottom of the interface for entering commands and messages.
Customize Configuration:


WeeChat has a comprehensive configuration system that allows you to customize its behavior. You can use the /set command to configure various options. For example:
/set irc.server.Freenode.nicks "YourNickname"
Adjust the settings according to your preferences.


Learn Shortcuts:
WeeChat has many keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate and perform actions more efficiently. Pressing Alt+h opens the help window where you can find a list of available commands and shortcuts.
Explore Plugins:


WeeChat supports plugins that add additional features. You can explore available plugins using the /script command. For example:
/script list
To install a plugin, you can use /script install plugin_name.
Read Documentation:


WeeChat has extensive documentation that you can access within the client. Use the /help command to get help on specific commands or topics.
