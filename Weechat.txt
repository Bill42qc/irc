WEECHAT


Connect to an IRC Server:

In WeeChat, you can connect to an IRC server using the /server command. For example:

/server add localhost 127.0.0.1/6667
/connect localhost

Set Connection Type to TCP:
After adding the server, set the connection type to TCP. Use the /set command to modify the server settings:


/set irc.server.localhost.addresses "localhost/6667"
/set irc.server.localhost.ssl off
Replace "example" with the name of your server. Setting ssl to off disables TLS and uses a regular TCP connection.

Connect to the Server:
Now, connect to the server using the name you assigned. For example:

bash
Copy code
/connect example
WeeChat will use the updated settings for this connection.







Join a Channel:
Once connected to a server, you can join a channel using the /join command. For example:

/join #example_channel


Switch between Buffers:
WeeChat uses the concept of "buffers" to manage different chat sessions and information. You can switch between buffers using the /buffer command or by pressing Alt+Left/Right Arrow keys.


Send Messages:
To send messages in a channel or private message, simply start typing your message and press Enter. WeeChat uses the input bar at the bottom of the interface for entering commands and messages.
Customize Configuration:


WeeChat has a comprehensive configuration system that allows you to customize its behavior. You can use the /set command to configure various options. For example:
