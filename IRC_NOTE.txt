basic IRC protocol specifications:

1. Connection Establishment:
	- IRC uses a client-server model where clients connect to the server.
	- Communication is typically done over TCP using port 6667 (or 6697 for SSL/TLS).
2. Message Format:
	- Messages are sent in the form of strings, terminated by CRLF ("\r\n").
	- Each message consists of three main parts: prefix, command, and parameters.
3. Prefix:
	- The prefix is optional and can identify the source of the message (e.g., the sender's nickname).
4. Command:
	- Commands are three or more uppercase alphanumeric characters.
	- Examples include JOIN, PART, PRIVMSG, MODE, etc.
5. Parameters:
	- Parameters follow the command and vary based on the command type.
	- Parameters can be separated by spaces and may include the target (channel or user) and additional information.
6. User Authentication:
	- Users identify themselves with a NICK command to set a nickname and a USER command to provide additional user details.
	- Some servers may require users to register their nickname for authentication.
7. Channels:
	- Channels are created and joined using the JOIN command.
	- Users communicate in channels using the PRIVMSG command.
8. Modes:
	- User and channel modes are set using the MODE command.
	- Modes control various aspects, such as user privileges or channel properties.
9. Private Messages:
	- Private messages between users are sent using the PRIVMSG command with the target user's nickname.
10. Commands for User Interaction:
	- Various commands allow users to interact with the server, join channels, send messages, and manage their presence.
11. Error Replies:
- The server responds to commands with specific numeric codes indicating success or failure.
  
  
  
  

3. Socket Programming:

Since C++98 lacks some of the modern abstractions for network programming, you'll need to rely on the standard C libraries for socket programming. Here's a brief overview:
